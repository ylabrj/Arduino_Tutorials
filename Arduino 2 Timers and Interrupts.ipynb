    "## What is an interrupt\n",
    "\n",
    "So you are running your void loop() code, where you keep checking forever if some input or signal level or other reading is really necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "_But is that really required?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Your desktop or laptop has dozens of things running. Is it looping around looking for keyboard or mouse input, or for something coming in from the Internet to update the page you're browsing?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another way of signaling events that's built in to most computers - interrupts. They do exactly what the name says. When an event happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  the processor interrupts the currently running program - but remembers where it left off\n",
    "*  the processor jumps to pre-specified section of code to deal with the interrupt\n",
    "*  when that's done, the processor returns to interrupted program, continuing exactly where it left off\n",
    "\n",
    "That section of code the processor jumps is referred to by different names - signal handler, interrupt handler, or, in the Arduino world, _*ISR*_ or __*Interrupt Service Routine*__\n",

    "Interrupts generally fall into two categories - external and internal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "On Arduino - and for that matter, on computers and microprocessors in general - interrupts are triggered by a change in voltage on one of the input pins. It might be when the digital value goes from LOW to HIGH (i.e. 0 to 5 volts), HIGH to LOW (5 volts back to 0), or either one - a change from the current signal level.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are *__external interrupts__* because they're coming in from outside of the processor, through one of the input pins.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of signal change can be triggered by anything attachded to the pin -  keyboard, a sensor, or any number of devices.\n",

    "### Internal interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal interrupts are generated by something happening _inside_ the processor. The most common example is a timer going off. Internal interrupt processing happens so fast that the timer can be going off and the ISR (Interrupt Service Routing) running hundreds or thousands of times a second. When our processor runs at 16 MHz (16 million clock cycles a second). Each low-level instruction in the processor takes 1 to 3 cycles to run. But note that each line of Arduino sketch code usually results in multiple low-level instructions. [You can read more about that here](https://cybergibbons.com/uncategorized/arduino-misconceptions-2-arduino-is-slow/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common form of interrupt is the timer. We can set it to run in a precise amount of time. The processor in the Arduino Uno has 3 separate timers and they are used in many different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "External interrupts' ISRs are set up differently than external interrupts. On external interrupts, we used the *attachinterrupt()* function, \n",
    "\n",
    "For internal interrupts, we don't need that function. It looks kind of weird when you look at it on sites with sample code, with something like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ISR(TIMER_COMPA_vect){\n",
    "      some instructions\n",

    "      some instructions\n",
    "   }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Elsewhere in the code, you will find some code that looks like gibberish:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  TCCR1B |= (1 << CS12);\n",
    "  TCCR1B |= (1 << CS10); \n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "To the novice, it looks weird for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  There is no reference to the ISR function. It's not called from anywhere else in the code\n",
    "*  There's no *attach_interrupt()* call to set it up.\n",
    "*  TIMER_OFF_vect or whatever other gibberish is in there is not defined anywhere in the code\n",
    "*  If you search on the Arduino website's documentation, you don't find (or at least I wasn't able to find) any reference to an ISR or SIGNAL functions, to TIMER_OVF_vect or to the other strange looking gibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: SIGNAL is an older version of ISR. It's no longer used - but you will still find it in examples on the Internet.\n",
